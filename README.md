# KaggleTitanicChallenge
I am currently working on a free online course to show how to solve the Kaggle Titanic challenge without coding using the free tool KNIME.

If you want to be informed once the course is live please sign-up here: https://forms.gle/wj42vSPYiBdAQTFf7

If you want to get the workflow from the Data Natives talk please download it from the DN2020 folder.
